## Workflow Status

The Quality Lens GitHub Action workflow has been added but requires `workflow` scope OAuth permissions to be pushed to the repository.

## Available Quality Checks

Based on repository scanning, the following quality tools are available:

- **ESLint**: Available in svelte-examples, @xyflow/react, @xyflow/svelte, @xyflow/system, @xyflow/monorepo
- **TypeScript**: Available in react-examples, svelte-examples, @xyflow/monorepo, @xyflow/react, @xyflow/svelte, @xyflow/system  
- **Testing**: Available in react-examples
- **Prettier**: Available in svelte-examples, @xyflow/svelte

## Next Steps

Once workflow permissions are resolved, Quality Lens will provide automated quality monitoring and reporting.
